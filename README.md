# Receipt Manager

A very simple python project made for a housemate to help them divide up shopping bills. 

Uses a basic pyqt6 interface that allows the user to select the .eml file containing an ASDA receipt, then prompts them to select which housemates each item was bought for. The program then calculates the total values owed for each party.
